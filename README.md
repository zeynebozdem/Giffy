#  ðŸŽ‰  Giffy   ðŸŽŠ


Hello! This is our first project, we hope you like it! 

ðŸ¤¡ GIPHY's GIF library is the largest in the world and includes millions of original GIFs directly from the world's best content partners, original GIF artists, as well as the best GIFs from across the entire internet. You can use this api on https://developers.giphy.com/docs/

ðŸ‘» I also use the swiper library of https://idangero.us/swiper/demos/ . This library is so useful and helps for your flexible swiper design. I use this library with emojies that is giffy's reactions! 

I include the gifs data to my project with xhr ajax request. You can learn xhr method with Jquery. Basicly used the html append with jquery, included infinite scroll by search value. 

This is guvensozmen's ui design and planning, i just coded and commented the design and decided the same design. He is the best ui designer i've ever seen ðŸ–¤ his dribble link on https://dribbble.com/guven
